# Tik_Tac_Toe_Python
This Python script implements the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in a console-based format. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 board until one of them achieves three in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or the board is filled, resulting in a draw.
